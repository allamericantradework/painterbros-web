            <em>We had Darren paint a room for us with a dry erase border around the entire room. The lines we perfect, he was very neat, and professional. The room looks better then I had imagined. I would highly recommend this company.</em>

            <em>Highly recommend!!!  The painting and carpentry work done in our dining room looks spectacular!  We opted for the batten boarding wainscoting design and we were blown away with how well it turned out.  Completely transformed the room.  Thanks again All American you guys do great work!!</em>
