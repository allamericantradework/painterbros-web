            <p>Zach was very polite and professional. He showed up when he said he would or would call if he was going to be delayed. He and Darren were thorough and efficient. They noticed flaws in the already painted areas and offered to repaint the areas for a very reasonable price. They painted doors and installed the door knobs, fixed drywall, detailed the ceiling and fixed drywall and painted the garage. They were very considerate of our home and belongings. We will be using thp again.</p>

            <p>The crew at All American were hired to do some painting, trim work and carpentry work at our business. They finished the job ahead of schedule. They worked around our business schedule and kept everything very clean and did not disturb our daily operations while getting the job done. Very pleased, excellent job!
